what are the goals of this article:
to provide a strategic take for software developers actively seeking a new work with 0 to 1 years of professional development experience. Read all of the sections or only sections relevant to you. 

who this article is written for:
- folks brand new to a software development career 
- freshly-professional software developers
- those looking to take their software creation hobby and expand into a full-time professional position
- professionals looking to spruce up their current perspectives on job hunting (especially those without direct networking connections, although there is information about that in further sections)

why this article was created:
    This article sprouted from the lack of direction I had when seeking out new work opportunities and also desired a condense conglomeration of resources to benefit my job searching.
